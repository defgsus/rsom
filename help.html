<h2>introduction</h2>

<p><i>Self-Organizing Maps</i> (som) or <i>Kohonen Networks</i> help to arange multi-dimensional data
on a low-dimensional surface to visualize the differences and similliarities between single data points.
Please check other sources for a detailed description of <i>som</i>s.</p>

<p>In this program, an audio file is split into small pieces, called <i>grains</i>, and the frequency
components of each grain are analyzed by a <i>discrete Fourier transform</i>. These <i>grains</i>, or
better their spectral data, is inserted into the <i>som</i>, one by one, iteratively. After some time,
each <i>grain</i> has a certain position in the map, where similiar <i>grains</i> are located near
each other. Similiar means, the frequency spectra of the grains are similiar.</p>

<p>For example, you can take a recording of someone speaking, generate the <i>som</i> and after training,
there will be clusters in the map for each vowel, 's' sound, fricative and whatever was in the recording.
This map can be exported to <i>NI Reaktor</i>'s table format to build awesome ensembles. E.g. you can build
a <i>grain synthesizer</i> where the 'sound color' can be selected by a x/y controller that scrolls through
the map. Since all <i>grains</i> are assorted for similiarity, you can have seamless transitions from one
vowel to the next by moving the x/y position, given the original recording contains such transitions.</p>

<p>However, there may be big differences in the spectra of the <i>grains</i> for some neighbouring
cells. You can imagine the <i>som</i>-training with spectral data as breaking down the high-
dimensional spectral data (say e.g. 32 bands or 32 dimensions) to two dimensions, x and y. Each
grain of the input sample is placed at a x,y-location so that it is close to similiar grains. Obviously,
clusters of different spectra still have to share the limited 2D space so they might end up close to each
other, although they are different. This might not be a problem for the things you want to do with the map.
It's just a basic property of kohonen networks.</p>



<p>That's the theory, however. To get such accurate results, in most cases some tweaking of the <i>som</i>
parameters is nescessary.</p>
